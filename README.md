# MyFridge
This project is focused in develop an app for control what's in my fridge and what do i need to buy. We can scan our product barcodes and keep and inventary. We'll use an open source api (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) for get information about products through the barcode. If a product isn't in the api we can create a new one and keep in our local database.
